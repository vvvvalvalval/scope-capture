(defmacro spy
  "Records the scope (i.e bindings of local names) and value
  of the expression it wraps at runtime;
  yields the value of the wrapped expression.

  At macro-expansion time, a Code Site Id (a negative integer)
  will be created and logged. Using this id, static information
  about the Code Site may be retrieved using (sc.api/cs-info cs-id).

  Each time the expression is evaluated, an Execution Point Id
  (a positive integer) will be created and logged.
  Dynamic information about this Execution Point
  (and the associated Code Site) may be retrieved using
  (sc.api/ep-info ep-id).

  Having noted the Execution Point Id, you can then 'recreate'
  the local runtime environment of the expression (its scope)
  using the `letsc` and `defsc` macros:

  (letsc ep-id
    ...)

  (defsc ep-id)

  The behaviour of this macro may be customized by passing a map literal
  as a first argument, containing some of the following keys:

  - :sc/spy-cs-logger-id (keyword, defaults to :sc.api.logging/log-spy-cs)
  The id of the logger function that will be called at macro-expansion time
  with Code Site information. This function must have been registered using
  `sc.api/register-cs-logger`.

  - :sc/spy-ep-pre-eval-logger-fn (expression, defaults to `sc.api.logging/log-spy-ep-pre-eval)
  An expression which evaluates to a function (typically a Var name), which will
  be invoked at runtime before the wrapped expression is evaluated with
  Execution Point information - typically to log the Execution Point Id.

  - :sc/spy-ep-post-eval-logger (expression, defaults to `sc.api.logging/log-spy-ep-post-eval)
  Like :sc/spy-ep-pre-eval-logger-fn, but the function will be invoked after the
  wrapped expression is evaluated - typically to log the value of the
  expression.

  - :sc/dynamic-vars (Seq of symbols, defaults to [])
  The names of the dynamic Vars which bindings should be captured at evaluation
  time.

  You may also provide your own defaults for these options by defining
  your own version of the `spy` macro: to do that,
  use `sc.api/spy-emit`.

  You can completely disable the logging and recording behaviour of `spy`
  at a given Code Site by using `(cs.api/disable! cs-id)`.

  You can discard the recorded information about a given Execution Point
  (typically for freeing memory) by using `(sc.api/dispose! ep-id)`.

(defmacro brk
  "Like `spy`, but will block the executing Thread until
  you release it from the REPL.

  There are 3 ways of resuming execution at an Execution Point
  where it was suspended by `brk`:

  - `(sc.api/loose ep-id)`: resumes execution by evaluating
  the wrapped expression.
  - `(sc.api/loose-with ep-id value)`: resumes execution by
  yielding `value` instead of evaluating the wrapped expression.
  - `(sc.api/loose-with-err ep-id err)`: resumes execution by
  throwing `err` instead of evaluating the wrapped expression.

  Similarly to `spy`, you can customize the behaviour of `brk`
  by passing a literal map of options; the accepted keys are:
  - :sc/brk-cs-logger-id
  - :sc/brk-ep-pre-eval-logger
  - :sc/brk-ep-post-eval-logger
  - :sc/dynamic-vars

  You can completely disable the logging, recording, and blocking behaviour of `spy`
  at a given Code Site by using `(cs.api/disable! cs-id)`.

  You can discard the recorded information about a given Execution Point
  (typically for freeing memory) by using `(sc.api/dispose! ep-id)`. Execution
  Points which are being blocked will see their execution resumed by
  throwing an Exception.

  Since you will likely need your REPL to un-block, you should never
  execute a `(brk ...)` block directly from your REPL thread!
